# Learning activities and resources
This week, I focused on how to use xampp to create a localhost for wordpress on your computer. I set up a child theme specifically to use WordPress for local network access. At the same time, I also searched for some tutorials to learn how to use xampp to establish this localhost, and successfully established a database to help our group work.

# Estimated Time
I spent approximately 4 hours of personal time this week studying this sub-title, including the time spent on the Prac4.
# Insights on Content
XAMPP is an easy way to create and run websites on your local computer. It includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and other components for web development. With XAMPP, you can quickly set up a server environment, test and develop your website locally. It also has a user-friendly control panel for managing the server and supports additional features like CMS installation and virtual hosts. XAMPP simplifies website creation and is popular among developers for its convenience and flexibility.
# Insights on Career/Employment/Learning
After completing the practical exercises, I decided to expand my knowledge of XAMPP by exploring additional resources. I started watching tutorial videos on YouTube to gain further insights into utilizing XAMPP for web development beyond what was covered in the exercises. During my exploration, I discovered alternative techniques for leveraging the controls provided by XAMPP, particularly in relation to managing databases.

One valuable lesson I learned was that XAMPP offers more than just a local server environment. It provides tools and functionalities that allow for efficient database management. I found out about features such as phpMyAdmin, which is a web-based interface for managing MySQL databases. This tool proved to be incredibly useful in creating, editing, and organizing databases within XAMPP.

Furthermore, I discovered that XAMPP supports additional components and plugins that can enhance my web development projects. For example, I learned about integrating Xdebug, a powerful debugging tool, which can greatly assist in identifying and resolving issues in PHP code.

By diversifying my learning approach and incorporating tutorial videos into my study strategy, I was able to gain new insights and deepen my understanding of XAMPP. I realized the importance of seeking out additional resources and exploring different materials to expand my skills in website development using XAMPP.
